Multiple Embedded Browsers in PyQt5 With Automation Supported and Sidebar Management

#### Introduction

In modern software development, integrating web browsing capabilities directly into desktop applications has become increasingly popular. PyQt5, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces, offers robust support for embedding web views within applications. This repository serves as both a guide and an implementation example for seamlessly integrating browsers into your PyQt5 projects.

#### Features

- **Integration**: Embed web content directly within your PyQt5 application's user interface.
- **Customization**: Customize the browsing experience to match your application's aesthetics and branding.
- **Interactivity**: Allow users to interact with web content seamlessly without resorting to external browsers.
- **Control**: Maintain control over user interactions and enforce security measures within the embedded browser environment.

#### Getting Started

To begin using PyQt5 Embedded Browser, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure PyQt5 is installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:

    ```
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Rafayjiwani/Multiple-Embedded-Browsers-in-PyQt5-With-Automation.git
    ```

3. **Run the Demo**: Navigate to the repository directory and execute the demo script to see the embedded browser in action:

    ```
    cd repo
    python main.py
    ```

#### Usage

To embed a browser within your PyQt5 application, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Browser Class**: Import the `Browser` class from the provided module into your Python script.

    ```python
    from embedded_browser import Browser
    ```

2. **Instantiate the Browser**: Create an instance of the `Browser` class within your application's UI layout.

    ```python
    browser = Browser()
    ```

3. **Integrate with UI**: Add the browser widget to your application's layout to display it to the user.

    ```python
    layout.addWidget(browser)
    ```

#### JavaScript Automation

One powerful feature of embedded browsers is the ability to automate interactions with web content using JavaScript. This capability opens up a wide range of possibilities for enhancing user experiences and streamlining workflows within your PyQt5 application.

```python
def on_load_finished(self, ok):
    """
    Triggered when the webpage is fully loaded
    """
    if ok:
        # Define JavaScript code to perform a search
        script = """
            let searchInput = document.querySelector("[name='q']");
            searchInput.focus();
            searchInput.click();
            searchInput.value = 'Your search query here';
            searchInput.click();
            let btn = document.querySelector('[aria-label="Google Search"]');
            btn.click();
        """

        # Execute the JavaScript code in the embedded browser
        self.run_javascript(script)
```

By leveraging JavaScript automation, you can programmatically interact with web content and perform tasks such as form submissions, data retrieval, and more, directly within your PyQt5 application.
